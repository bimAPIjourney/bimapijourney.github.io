## 5 Steps to become a Revit API Developer

1. Reproduce the output of the Dynamo nodes that you use the most using Python
2. Convert a Dynamo script into Python code
3. Convert the Python code into C# macro
4. Convert the macro into an External Command using Visual Studio
5. Create a new tab in the #Revit UI and a button to call your code

If you have previous experience in coding, you can skip Python and directly start writing C# code which can be easier.

Begin by writing scripts that perform a single task and consist of no more than 30 lines of code.

Dynamo is an excellent tool for quickly prototyping ideas and creating scripts, but issues like deployment challenges, version compatibility, limited out-of-the-box nodes, and slower execution times can sometimes hinder the user experience.

The visual scripting process in Dynamo, along with the ability to debug by checking node outputs, offers a great introduction to coding. It helps break down complex problems into smaller, manageable code segments and enables you to track data flow, transformations, and structure as they pass between nodes.
